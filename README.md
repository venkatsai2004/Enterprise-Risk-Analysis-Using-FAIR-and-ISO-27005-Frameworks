# Enterprise-Risk-Analysis-Using-FAIR-and-ISO-27005-Frameworks


## üîç Overview

This repository documents my hands-on exploration and analysis of key open-source tools used in the field of risk management and security assessment. It is aligned with industry standards such as ISO 27005 and the FAIR (Factor Analysis of Information Risk) model.

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my practical understanding of the tools, techniques, and frameworks relevant to the role of Associate Analyst ‚Äì Risk Management, such as at EY and other professional services firms.

## üõ† Tools Explored

### 1. ThalesGroup/security-risk-assessment-tool
- **Type**: Electron-based GUI application
- **Purpose**: ISO 27005-compliant risk assessments
- **Key Features**:
  - Asset, threat, vulnerability identification
  - Risk calculation based on threat likelihood and impact
  - Exportable reports and customizable assessments
- **Hands-on**:
  - Cloned, built, and used to simulate a risk scenario involving a fictitious enterprise IT system.
  - Learned the risk calculation flow and ISO 27005 structure.

### 2. davidski/evaluator
- **Type**: FAIR-based quantitative risk analysis toolkit in R
- **Purpose**: Enables data-driven, probabilistic risk assessments
- **Key Features**:
  - Monte Carlo simulations
  - Risk quantification using FAIR methodology
  - Model calibration using real-world data
- **Hands-on**:
  - Ran sample simulations
  - Analyzed outputs for loss magnitude and frequency estimates
  - Reflected on its applicability to corporate cybersecurity risk assessments

## üéØ Skills Demonstrated

- Risk Assessment Methodologies (ISO 27005, FAIR)
- Quantitative Risk Modeling and Simulation
- R Programming Basics for Risk Analysis
- Security Control Mapping and Asset Classification
- Critical Thinking on Threats, Vulnerabilities, and Mitigation

How to run
Just download the zip file for your platform and unzip it and execute sratool or SRATool, depending on your platform. It is generic enough to be used by any organization, but some of the items may be more related to Thales DIS, in that case the json-schema.js should be adapted accordingly to your organization needs.

Credits
Frederic Paillart who managed the initial version of the tool using Infopath
Megan Liow for the initial port to Electron.
Alvin Siah for the major improvements to the Electron version.
Sun Fang who reviewed and helped us improve the JSON Schema
Thomas Delplanque who improved error management and corrected several issues.
All other people including Philippe Biton, Frank Converset, Antoine Galland, Patrick George, Karen Lu, Sebastien Petit, Petr Skripal, who improved, commented and/or worked on the ISRA methodology throughout the years.
Since this methodology has been around for several years internally, we may have missed some names who contributed to it, our apologies if its the case.

## üìà Future Additions

- Create a sample organization profile and run a complete risk analysis using both tools
- Integrate FAIR outputs into a visual dashboard using Power BI or Tableau
- Explore how these tools align with GRC platforms used in enterprise risk management
